Please cite the paper "Generalized Framework to Subspace-based DOA Estimation”. 

For estimating the noise covariance matrix for the cases of uniform and nonuniform sensor noise, the ISB method is used.
Please cite the paper "A Novel Angular Estimation Method in the Presence of Nonuniform Noise”.

For estimating the noise covariance matrix for the case of block-diagonal sensor noise, the BDISB method is used.
Please cite the paper "Noise Covariance Matrix Estimation in Block-Correlated Noise Field for Direction Finding”.
Note that the dimensions of the blocks of the noise covariance matrix should be known. If the dimensions of the blocks
are different with the dimensions used in this paper, the dimensions should be revised in "BDISB” function accordingly.
